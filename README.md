  # hex2png
batch convert from hexidecimal color codes to png images of their solid colors.


  my first code (simply because i could not be asked to spend 1 hour to open up an art tool and slowly fill bucket and then save image 50 different times, and decided to spend 6 hours learning to code instead!) so probably a little inefficient!

  couldn't find a tool like this anywhere on github or elsewhere so decided to upload it just in case anyone else needed it.


notes:
  - the default size of the downloaded pngs is (500,500)
  - don't make fun of my clunky text and using of uneeded libraries i'm new here :sob:
